# DS-for-PST-Challenge-Problem
This repository warehouses data that formed an inspiration for a curriculum project.  The curriculum presents data science to preservice mathematics teachers to prepare them to teach data science at the secondary level.

The file "AIS Challenge Overview Slide" illustrates the challenge problem from AIS data.
The dataset that was used in the challenge problem is file "AIS Challenge Problem Set 3".
The other files contain code that uses the algorithm we developed.
